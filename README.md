-  My colleagues and I found a problem facing dentists in the sizes of the mouth props available in markets and that they do not suit all patients, as they are available in three sizes only small, medium and large. Some people have sizes between small and medium or between medium and larg, so we made this modern innovation!!

- Our innovation was to design just one piece that can be moved to zoom in and out to fit seven different mouth sizes.

- it was our project you can see much more detels about our presentashion 


> The design was created by **Autodesk Fusion 360** computer software.
