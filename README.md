My colleagues and I found a problem facing dentists in the sizes of the mouth props available in markets and that they do not suit all patients, as they are available in three sizes only small, medium and large. Some patients have sizes between small and medium or between medium and larg, so we made this innovation!!

Our innovation was to design just one piece that can be moved to zoom in and out to fit seven different mouth sizes.

It was our project in **Bioengineering Design** course at King Saud University, and it is one of my favorite. you can see much more details about our full presentation in the uploaded files.

## The presentation contains:
1. Design classification
2. Product design specifications
3. Detailed design
4. Design evaluation and risk assessment
5. Example of design life cycles
6. Team formation and team members role


> The design was created by **Autodesk Fusion 360** computer software.
